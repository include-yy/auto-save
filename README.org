*  What is tetosave?

- No need to save manually, protect your fingers.
- Cleanup trailing backspace

This package is folked from lazycat's auto-save, plus some improvements.

**  Installation

1. Clone or download this repository

2. In your config file, add the following lines:

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
     (add-to-list 'load-path "<path-to-tetosave>")
     (require 'tetosave)
     (tetosave-enable)

     ;;; OPTIONAL
     ;;; custom predicates if you don't want auto save.
     ;;; example: disable auto save mode when current filetype is an gpg file.
     (add-to-list 'tetosave-disable-predicates
	   (lambda ()
	     (string-suffix-p
	      "gpg"
	      (file-name-extension (buffer-name)) t)))
   #+END_SRC

For more detailed customization, see comments in =tetosave.el=.

* Suggestions

Emacs' default auto-save is stupid to generate #foo# files. You can add these lines to disable them:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq make-backup-files nil)
  (setq auto-save-default nil)
  (setq create-lockfiles nil)
#+END_SRC
