*  What is tetosave?

- No need to save manually, protect your fingers.
- Cleanup trailing backspace

This package is folked from lazycat's auto-save, plus some improvements(IMO).

**  Installation

1. Clone or download this repository, and add its path to =load-path=:
   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
     (add-to-list 'load-path <path-to-tetosave)
   #+END_SRC
   If you are using Emacs 29 or above, you can use =package-vc= to get it like this(without need to add =load-path=)
   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
     (add-to-list 'package-vc-selected-packages
		  '(tetosave :url "https://github.com/include-yy/tetosave"
			     :vc-backend Git))
     (package-vc-install-selected-packages)
   #+END_SRC

2. In your config file, add the following lines:

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
     (use-package tetosave
       :config
       (setopt tetosave-idle 0.5)
       (tetosave-enable)
       ;; OPTIONAL
       ;; custom predicates if you don't want auto save.
       ;; example: disable tetosave when current filetype is an gpg file.
       (add-to-list 'tetosave-disable-predicates
		    (defun init/teto-pred-gpg ()
		      (eq major-mode 'authinfo-mode))))
   #+END_SRC

For more detailed customization, see comments in =tetosave.el=.

* Suggestions

Emacs' default auto-save is stupid to generate #foo# files. You can add these lines to disable them:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq make-backup-files nil)
  (setq auto-save-default nil)
  (setq create-lockfiles nil)
#+END_SRC
